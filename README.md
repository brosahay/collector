# collector

A simple script to fetch results in batch mode and store in CSV <br>
A simple HTML parser for WBUT results. <br>
I got bored with the huge waits and putting in values to get results of me and my friends hence the script to make it fast and easy based on python3.

### RUN:

`python fetch_result.py`

### TODO:
- [ ] Make a similar parser on C#.
